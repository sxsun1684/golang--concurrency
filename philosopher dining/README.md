# Testing `dine` Function in Go

This document describes the two test functions written to validate the `dine` function using the Go `testing` package. The tests aim to ensure that the dining philosophers problem is handled correctly under different conditions, including varying delays and normal execution.

## 1. `Test_dine` Function
The `Test_dine` function verifies that the `dine` function operates correctly without any delays. It ensures that the slice `orderFinished`, which tracks the order in which philosophers finish dining, always has a length of 5 (indicating that 5 philosophers completed their dining process).

- **Setting `eatTime`, `sleepTime`, and `thinkTime` to 0**: This means there is no delay for eating, sleeping, or thinking.
- **Resetting `orderFinished = []string{}`**: Before each iteration, the slice is reset to an empty state. This slice is expected to store the order in which philosophers finish their meals.
- **Calling `dine()`**: Executes the main logic of the philosophers dining.
- **Checking the length of `orderFinished`**: The test checks if the length of `orderFinished` equals 5. If not, an error is raised with a message indicating the incorrect length.

This test runs the `dine` function 10 times to ensure consistency in the results, ensuring that all 5 philosophers finish dining each time.

### Code Example:
```go
func Test_dine(t *testing.T) {
	eatTime = 0 * time.Second
	sleepTime = 0 * time.Second
	thinkTime = 0 * time.Second

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		orderFinished = []string{}
		dine()
		if len(orderFinished) != 5 {
			t.Errorf("incorrect length of slice; expected 5 but got %d", len(orderFinished))
		}
	}
}
```

## 2. `Test_dineWithVaryingDelays` Function

This test function validates the `dine` function under varying delay conditions. By setting different values for `eatTime`, `sleepTime`, and `thinkTime`, it checks if the function behaves correctly with different delays.

### Defining `theTests` slice:

This is an anonymous struct that contains a `name` (to describe the test) and `delay` (the time delay for the philosophers' actions). The tests include:

- **Zero delay** (0 seconds)
- **Quarter-second delay** (250 milliseconds)
- **Half-second delay** (500 milliseconds)

### Looping through `theTests`:

For each test case, the `orderFinished` slice is reset, and the `eatTime`, `sleepTime`, and `thinkTime` are set to the respective delay values.

### Calling `dine()`:

Executes the dining logic with the configured delays.

### Checking the length of `orderFinished`:

After `dine()` runs, the test checks that the slice has a length of 5. If it does not, the test fails and prints an error message, including the test case name.

### Code Example:
```go
func Test_dineWithVaryingDelays(t *testing.T) {
	var theTests = []struct{
		name string
		delay time.Duration
	}{
		{"zero delay", time.Second * 0},
		{"quarter second delay", time.Millisecond * 250},
		{"half second delay", time.Millisecond * 500},
	}

	for _, e := range theTests {
		orderFinished = []string{}

		eatTime = e.delay
		sleepTime = e.delay
		thinkTime = e.delay

		dine()
		if len(orderFinished) != 5 {
			t.Errorf("%s: incorrect length of slice; expected 5 but got %d", e.name, len(orderFinished))
		}
	}
}
```
### Explanation of Key Components:

- **`orderFinished`**: This slice stores the order in which the philosophers finish dining. The tests ensure that it contains exactly 5 elements, one for each philosopher, after `dine()` has completed.

- **`eatTime`, `sleepTime`, `thinkTime`**: These global variables control the delays for eating, sleeping, and thinking, respectively. The tests manipulate these values to simulate different delays and ensure that the logic remains correct.

### Purpose of These Tests:

- **`Test_dine`**: Verifies that the `dine` function behaves correctly without any delays and ensures that 5 philosophers always finish dining.

- **`Test_dineWithVaryingDelays`**: Checks if the `dine` function works correctly under different delay conditions (0s, 250ms, 500ms) and still ensures the proper completion of all 5 philosophers.

These tests are essential for validating the concurrency logic in the dining philosophers problem and ensuring that the function performs as expected in different scenarios.
